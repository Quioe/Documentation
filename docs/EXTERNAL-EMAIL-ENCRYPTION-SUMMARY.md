# External Email Encryption - Quick Summary

## 🎯 What You Asked For

Enable sending encrypted emails to **normal email providers** (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) where:
1. The email contains **only a secure link** (no actual content)
2. Recipient clicks the link and must **unlock** with either:
   - **OTP** (one-time password sent to their email)
   - **Private Key** (upload their key file)
3. This works for **ALL security levels** (0-6)
4. Message **self-destructs** after failed attempts or expiration

## ✅ Good News!

**Most of the infrastructure already exists!** Your codebase has:
- ✅ Encrypted email endpoints (`encrypted_email_endpoints.py`)
- ✅ OTP service (`otp_service.py`)  
- ✅ Encrypted storage (`encrypted_storage.py`)
- ✅ HTML email templates (`email_templates.py`)

**What's needed:**
- 🔄 Frontend unlock page at `/view/[accessId]`
- 🔄 Integration with compose page
- 🔄 SMTP configuration for external delivery
- 🔄 Routing logic to detect external providers

4. API Routes (2-3 hours)
5. SMTP Setup (2 hours)
6. Testing (3-4 hours)
7. Documentation (2 hours)
8. Monitoring (2 hours)

## 🤔 Questions I Need You to Answer

### 1. SMTP Provider Choice
Which provider should we use for sending emails?

**Options**:
- **Postmark** ⭐ Recommended - $10/month for 10,000 emails, excellent deliverability
- **SendGrid** - Free tier 100/day, popular but more spam filtering
- **AWS SES** - Cheapest (¢0.10 per 1000), requires more setup
- **Gmail SMTP** - Simplest setup but limited and may flag as spam

**Your choice**: Postmark

### 2. Default Message Expiration (TTL)
How long should messages be accessible before auto-deletion?

**Options**:
- **24 hours** - Most secure, forces quick access
- **7 days** - More convenient for users
- **Variable by security level** - Level 0: 7 days, Level 3+: 24 hours

**Your choice**: Keep options for users

### 3. Force Encryption Default
Should "force encryption" be ON or OFF by default when composing?

**Options**:
- **ON by default** - More secure, all external emails encrypted automatically
- **OFF by default** - User decides, more flexibility

**Your choice**: Off

### 4. Private Key Format Support
Which private key formats should we accept for unlocking?

**Options**:
- **PEM only** (.pem, .key) - Simplest, most common
- **Multiple formats** (PEM, DER, JWK) - More complex but flexible

**Your choice**: ITs your call
### 5. Unlock Page Theme
Should the unlock page match the main app's glassmorphic theme?

**Options**:
- **Match main app** - Consistent branding, requires theme files
- **Standalone lightweight** - Faster loading, works without main app

**Your choice**: Match the main app

## 🚀 How It Will Work

### User Experience Flow:

```
1. Sakshi composes email in quieo
   ↓
2. Enters recipient: aryan@gmail.com
   ↓
3. quieo detects Gmail (external provider)
   ↓
4. Shows: "📧 Will send encrypted link to aryan@gmail.com"
   ↓
5. Sakshi clicks "Send" (force encryption is ON)
   ↓
6. quieo:
   - Encrypts message with selected security level
   - Stores encrypted content in Redis
   - Generates secure access link: https://ryker.my.id/view/abc123xyz...
   - Sends beautiful HTML email to aryan@gmail.com with link
   ↓
7. Aryan receives email in Gmail with:
   - Professional template
   - Security level badge
   - Clear instructions
   - Big "🔓 View Secure Message" button
   ↓
8. Aryan clicks button → Opens https://ryker.my.id/view/abc123xyz...
   ↓
9. Unlock page shows:
   - Message info (from Sakshi, subject, security level)
   - TTL countdown timer
   - 3 unlock options:
     • Request OTP (sends 6-digit code to aryan@gmail.com)
     • Upload Private Key (if Aryan has quieo account)
     • Enter Passphrase (if Sakshi set one)
   ↓
10. Aryan chooses "Request OTP"
    ↓
11. Receives email with 6-digit code
    ↓
12. Enters code → Message unlocked!
    ↓
13. Decrypted content displayed securely
```

### Security Features:
- ✅ Messages encrypted at rest using KMS
- ✅ Access tokens are cryptographically secure (32+ bytes)
- ✅ Maximum 3 unlock attempts before self-destruct
- ✅ Rate limiting: 5 OTP requests per hour per IP
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ No sensitive data in emails or logs
- ✅ Automatic expiration based on TTL

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Advantages:
✅ **Universal Compatibility** - Works with any email provider  
✅ **Maximum Security** - Content never exposed in email  
✅ **User-Friendly** - Simple OTP unlock for non-technical users  
✅ **Self-Destruct** - Messages don't linger indefinitely  
✅ **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all access attempts  
✅ **Scalable** - Redis storage handles millions of messages  
✅ **Cost-Effective** - SMTP costs only for notification emails  

### Considerations:
⚠️ **Requires Link Click** - Recipients must click link (extra step)  
⚠️ **SMTP Reputation** - Need to warm up sending reputation  
⚠️ **OTP Delays** - Email delivery not instant (usually <30s)  
⚠️ **User Education** - Recipients need to understand process  

## 🎨 Visual Preview

The unlock page will feature:
- 🎨 Glassmorphic design matching your app theme
- ⏱️ Live countdown timer showing TTL remaining
- 🔐 Three clear unlock method tabs
